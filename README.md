# Multimodal-Fusion-3D-segmentation
Multi-modal Sensor Fusion for 3D segmentation: A Survey

This repo is used for recording, tracking, and benchmarking several recent multimodal 3D segmentation methods, as
a supplement to our servey.
If you find any work missing or have any suggestions (papers, implementations and other resources), feel free to
pull requests. We will add the missing papers to this repo ASAP.
